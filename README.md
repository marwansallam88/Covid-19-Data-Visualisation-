5.      A widget to select what to plot: cases, deaths, or both.
6.      A widget to select whether to plot cumulative data or daily numbers.

Key aspects:

• Developed interactive dashboards using MATLAB to visualize infection trends across regions.

• Performed data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and time-series plotting.
